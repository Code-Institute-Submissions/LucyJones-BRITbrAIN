# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

#### Purpose

The purpose of this site is to create a fun interactive quiz for the user whilst developing both their general and geographical knowledge of Britain. My decision to create this site was based on a family interest in map games and my lack of general knowledge on Britain. By completing this project I will have shown greater experience using Javascript and hopefully expanded my knowledge on Britain.

#### User stories

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. A user-friendly site that is easy to navigate.

2. An enjoyable, interactive quiz to play.

3. An easily accessible button to start the quiz.

4. Clear instructions for the user on how to play.

5. Recorded score and leaderboard, for the user to check personal performance and ranking against other players.

6. A question counter to keep track of the user's progress throughout the quiz.

7. A quiz timer to limit the length of the game.

8. Ability to contact me through an online form.

9. About us and features section on site.

10. Links to external social media sites.

#### Design

- **Structure**

  - A simple design structure with a fixed dropdown menu and scroll arrows to allow easy navigation throughout the site.

- **Colour scheme**

  - The colour scheme is primarily based around peaches in association with the brain and extra colours were added to compliment the palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co).
  - I have used the 'opacity' property to create lighter and darker shades throughout the site.

    ![Colour Scheme](assets/images/readme/colourScheme.png)

- **Typography**

  - The main font used throughout the site is 'Raleway' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

  - I have used 'Ranchers' font for the 'BRITbrAIN' title as it is fun and pairs well with the Brain theme.

  - Sans Serif as the fallback font if for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

#### Wireframes

As part of the design process, before starting my project I sketched out initial drawings then used <u>Balsamiq</u> to create sharper-looking wireframes. Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.

  - Attractive, minimalistic design with visuals and information presented clearly and concisely.
  - Easily readable fonts and simple navigation throughout the site.

- **Option for the user to reach out**

  - A contact form with submit button for users to easily get in touch via my website.
  - The form has been set up to ensure all fields are filled out and that the email is written in the correct format.
  - The form uses JSemail to allow messages to be sent directly to my Gmail account.

- **Timer**

  - Interactive 30s circle countdown timer created using HTML, CSS and javascript.

- **Leaderboard**
  - Players can access a game leaderboard created through javascript and local storage.

#### To-do list:

#### Status

> Project is: <u>ongoing</u>

I will continue to update my quiz with new questions to allow my users to play frequently. I also have future development plans which I have listed below.

**Future Development plans**

- As my game expands I will merge all my javascript files into one, as well as all my CSS files. This will ensure that my game loading stays efficient and creates the best experience for my user.

- Create different levels of difficulty- easy, medium and hard;

  - Tailored questions for each level.
  - Breaking up regions further into smaller areas, such as cities.

- Create different games focusing on specific categories such as British landmarks.

- Social media icons are currently linked to my Github page, the Instagram home-page and my Linkedin profile. If the game progresses I will create customized social links for BRITbrAIN to create further player interaction.

#### Accessing code

Follow the steps below if you are wanting to propose changes to the project or to use the project as a starting point for your own idea.

- **Forking the GitHub Repository**

  Forking allows you to create a copy of the original repository and propose changes to the repository owner via a pull request.

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.

  ![forking](assets/images/readme/forking.png)

  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

#### Manual function testing

To ensure my site was working correctly I carried out some manual function testing as follows:

**1. Site navigation**

- I checked the site dropdown menu was working correcting by starting on the home-page and navigating around the site from and to every screen the user would be faced with.
- I checked the scroll navigation arrows on the home-page was working by clicking through each section one by one.
- Links to external social platforms were checked by ensuring when clicked that the user would be navigated to the site based on the icon.

**2. Hover, focus and active effects**

- Hovered over the following button elements to ensure the correct brightness effects were in place;
  - 'Leaderboard' link in dropdown menu
  - social icons in dropdown menu
  - 'Send' button on contact form
  - 'Start quiz' button
  - 'Let's go' button
  - 'Submit', 'PLAY AGAIN' and 'LEADERBOARD' buttons on end screen

**3. Score countdown function**

- To check the score count was adding and subtracting correctly depending on the user's selected answer, I clicked 'START QUIZ' and went on to click a right answer and then a wrong. Ten points were added for the first, and minus five for the second so I knew it was working correctly.

**4. Question counter function**

- To make sure the question counter was increasing by one every time the user moved onto a different question I started the game and checked the value after each time a new question was given. This moved up by one each time so I knew this function was working well.

**5. Timer countdown and animation**

- The countdown timer starts at thirty, decreasing by one every second until the timer hits zero and the game ends. The game end pop-up always popped up when the timer reached zero which showed it was functioning as it should be.

**6. Toggle function**

- To check the toggle was working I started the game and clicked the button once to hide the question then again to see if the question reappeared. And it did. This was tested throughout multiple questions.

**7. Shuffled questions**

- I played the quiz multiple times to ensure that each time the questions appeared they were different and also that none were repeated more than once. This was indeed the case so I knew the shuffled question maths was working correctly.

**8. Sending email via contact form using emailJS**

- I added an alert on my javascript file for when a message was sent with success.
- I filled out the contact form and sent myself a message multiple times to see if I received it to my Gmail account, which I did.

**9. Leaderboard name and score input**

- To ensure the names and scores were adding correctly to the leaderboard I played multiple times to see if the name and score matched correctly.
- I also played over 10 times to ensure that the top 10 best scores were the ones being kept on the leaderboard.

**10. Submitting score only when the username is entered**

- I played the game and when presented with the end pop-up I tried to submit my score before entering my username. As desired, the button was not clickable until I had entered text into the input box.

#### Automated testing

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to run a series of audits to improve the quality of web pages.

#### Validator checks

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. Code was entered through direct input. JS hint was used to check for any errors with my Javascript files.

  No error or warning messages received.

- [**CSS Validator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

  One warning message received;

  ![CSS Validator error](assets/images/readme/css-validatorError.png)

  Code not altered as this is a valid property in css.
