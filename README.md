# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

#### Purpose

The purpose of this site is to create a fun interactive quiz for the user whilst developing both their general and geographical knowledge on Britain. My decision to create this site was based on a family interest of map games and my lack of general knowledge on Britain. By completing this project I will have shown greater experience using Javascript and hopefully expanded my knowledge of my country.

#### User stories

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. A user friendly site that is easy to navigate.

2. An enjoyable, interactive quiz to play which also aims to develop their knowledge on Britain.

3. An easily accessible button to start the quiz.

4. Clear instructions for the user on how to play.

5. Recorded score and leaderboard, for user to check personal performance and ranking against other players.

6. A question counter to keep track of their progress throughout the quiz.

7. A timer to limit the time per question to add further interaction for the user and prevent any users from cheating.

8. Ability to contact me through an online form.

9. About us and features section on site.

10. Links to social media sites.

#### Design

- **Structure**

  - A simple design structure with a dropdown menu and page navigation to allow easy navigation throughout site.

- **Colour scheme**

  - The colour scheme is primarily based around peaches in association with the brain and extra colours were added to compliment the palette using [Coolors](https://coolors.co).
  - I have used the 'opacity' property to create lighter and darker shades.

    ![Colour Scheme](assets/images/readme/colourScheme.png)

- **Typography**

  - The main font used throughout the site is 'Raleway' belongs to the sans-serif typeface family and is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.
  
  - Ranchers font has been used for the 'BRITbrAIN' logo to add fun with its general style comparison with the Brain.
  
  - Sans Serif as the fallback font if for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

#### Wireframes

As part of the design process, before starting my project I sketched out initial drawings then used <u>Balsamiq</u> to create sharper looking wireframes. Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for my site.
